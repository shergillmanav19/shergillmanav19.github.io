          <p>
            Hi, my name is Manav Shergill and i am a 4rd year Software
            Engineering Student at the University of Victoria. I have a passion for software, technology, and
            basketball. I have taken various fundamental programming classes
            throughout my studies at Uvic and found them to be super helpful and interesting. Java is my favorite because it is the language that
            helped me understand objected oriented programming. I have also
            explored and worked with several other programming languages such as
            C, Python, and React throughout assignments or during my
            personal time. After working on personal projects and group projects
            related to software, my interest grew exponentially in programming
            and i decided to pursue Software Engineering as my career.

            <p>
              Profitly is a tracker app for stocks from all of the exchanges that i invest on which are Wealthsimple and 
              Questrade. The web app made using React allows me to switch between different time frames (1d, 1m, 1y) and display all of my positions held
              for seperate accounts (TFSA, Personal, RRSP). I also have made a backend from scratch using the Flask framework which handles 
              requests from the frontend such as logging in or a request for data for a different timeline.
            <br />
            <br/>
              The web app only has information about my investments as i didnt want to handle different user sensitive information. Therefore,
               to use the web app, you would have to login via an admin email which im happy to login with and show it to you over zoom.

              This project was made for UVIC student so they don't struggle with timetable building for UVIC courses. Current UVIC timetable
              builder is hard to navigate around and often doesn't show useful information. CourseUP involved a team of developers from VikeLabs (Software club at UVIC) where we all collaborated to work on the app.
              The feature i ended up creating were the bookmark ,filtering of courses, and a sidebar. This project relied on the UVIC scraper project (listed below in project section)
              because we needed to scrape the data off of UVIC website to then use it on the web app.

              This was one of my first personal projects with Java. In this
              project, I create a tic tac toe game to be played by 2 people
              alternating turns in the terminal. This project led to me
              familiarizing myself with the objected oriented programming. I
              also learned about taking the user input through the terminal
              which was done using the Scanner class.

              that was entered. Unsplash is a website which allows users to get
              stock free photos. I wanted to learn how to make calls to an API,
              so i decided to implement this project. I learned what the
              response looks like from an API and how to parse it and then later
              display it on the page. Some CSS3 was used to make the webpage
              look appealing.

              the project was to create an API to allow easy access to Uvic's

              of creating the API is to use for creating a timetable builder
              webapp which would make the scheduling process very easy for the
              Uvic students. We used TypeScript and Node.js.

                Terraformes is a crypto game which i decied to do freelance work for in my december
                holidays. I developed the webapp which allows users to view their inventory, mine and claim lands,
                and unpack page for unboxing any packs. All of these features were designed by having user priorities in mind.
                The webapp calls the wax blockchain's smart contracts whenever a user decides to claim or unpack a land. Moreover,
                i also integrated the wax cloud wallets and anchor wallet capabilities which allows for secure login and easy access of a user's assests.

                I also created a web page with search functionality that displayed the
                bestselling products in the company. Moreover, i created a seperate web page
                for bestselling products in their own group to see which group had the bestsellers.
                I also used SQL queries to scan through data and join tables to get wanted results.

                some unit and integration testing. 3 months into the workterm i
                was given a React task. The task was to adjust and add different
