          Hi, my name is Manavjeet Shergill and I am Full-Stack Software Engineer at a startup called Lobby. I have a
          strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development, as well as a passion for
          problem-solving and continually learning and improving my skills. I have experience working with a variety of
          programming languages, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, React, and NodeJS. I have a track record of
          developing and deploying multiple web applications from start to finish. With my strong communication skills
          and ability to work effectively in team environments, I am confident in my ability to contribute to and thrive

            <h2>Full-stack Software Engineer</h2>
            <p>
              I worked as a full stack developer, using technologies such as TypeScript, NextJS, NodeJS,
              React, PostgreSQL, and GraphQL to develop revenue-earning products from start to finish. I am proud of the
              achievements
              I made at this company, including getting our first dollar of revenue from a product that I helped build
              and solving an
              important bug that was hindering our ability to earn fees. My experience at Lobby allowed me to hone my
              skills in full
              stack development and make meaningful contributions to the success of the company. <br /><br />I gained
              experience with the following tools/technologies:

            <h1>Mojio Inc</h1>
            <h2>Full-stack Software Co-op</h2>
            <p>
              During my co-op at Mojio, I led a team of 2 frontend engineers to develop an internal tool that aimed to
              solve
              multiple customer support needs, such as viewing vehicle compatibility, order lookup, and displaying
              detailed order
              information. I was able to deliver and develop the internal tool in under 1.5 months, and also contributed
              to design and
              backend meetings for the project. In addition, I was responsible for communicating meeting information to
              stakeholders
              and adding a security layer to the internal tool using OKTA for authorization and JWT for authentication.
              This co-op
              opportunity allowed me to gain valuable experience in team leadership and full stack development, as well
              as demonstrate
              my ability to deliver high-quality solutions under tight timelines. <br /><br />I gained experience with

              This was my first Coop as a software engineering student. For
              most part of my workterm i used selenium to create automated
              tests for the different web pages. However, in the start i did
              some unit and integration testing. 3 months into the workterm i
              was given a React task. The task was to adjust and add different
              columns to the newly developing web page. During my last month,
              i was put in charge of the Jenkins build to check if any
              unexpected classes failed. If they did it was my duty to fix
              them. <br /><br />I gained experience with the following tools/technologies:

              My second co-op work term at Gabriel Ross Inc involved me doing
              various tasks throughout the day. My day would usually start with
              refactoring of php files to use Magento 2 unless a bug came up.
              I also created a web page with search functionality that displayed the
              bestselling products in the company. Moreover, i created a seperate web page
              for bestselling products in their own group to see which group had the bestsellers.
              I also used SQL queries to scan through data and join tables to get wanted results.

              Terraformes is a crypto game which i decied to do freelance work for in my december
              holidays. I developed the webapp which allows users to view their inventory, mine and claim lands,
              and unpack page for unboxing any packs. All of these features were designed by having user priorities in
              mind.
              The webapp calls the wax blockchain's smart contracts whenever a user decides to claim or unpack a land.
              Moreover,
              i also integrated the wax cloud wallets and anchor wallet capabilities which allows for secure login and
              easy access of a user's assests.

            Current UVIC timetable
            builder is hard to navigate around and often doesn't show useful information. CourseUP involved a team of
            developers from VikeLabs (Software club at UVIC) where we all collaborated to work on the app.
            The feature i ended up creating were the bookmark ,filtering of courses, and a sidebar. This project relied
            on the UVIC scraper project (listed below in project section)
            because we needed to scrape the data off of UVIC website to then use it on the web app.

            familiarizing myself with the objected oriented programming. I
            also learned about taking the user input through the terminal
            which was done using the Scanner class.

            stock free photos. I wanted to learn how to make calls to an API,
            so i decided to implement this project. I learned what the

            display it on the page. Some CSS3 was used to make the webpage
