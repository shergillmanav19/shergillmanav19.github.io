          <p>
            Hi, my name is Manav Shergill and i am a 3rd year Software
            Engineering Student at the University of Victoria. I am currently 20
            years old and have a passion for software, technology, and
            basketball. I have taken various fundamental programming classes
            throughout my studies at Uvic and found them to be super helpful and interesting. Java is my favoruite because it is the language that
            helped me understand objected oriented programming. I have also
            explored and worked with several other programming languages such as
            C, Python, and React throughout assignments or during my
            personal time. After working on personal projects and group projects
            related to software, my interest grew exponentially in programming
            and i decided to pursue Software Engineering as my career.

            <p>
              This was one of my first personal projects with Java. In this
              project, I create a tic tac toe game to be played by 2 people
              alternating turns in the terminal. This project led to me
              familiarizing myself with the objected oriented programming. I
              also learned about taking the user input through the terminal
              which was done using the Scanner class.

              In this project i use React to make calls to the Unsplash API
              which returns me the top 5 pictures associated with the keyword
              that was entered. Unsplash is a website which allows users to get
              stock free photos. I wanted to learn how to make calls to an API,
              so i decided to implement this project. I learned what the
              response looks like from an API and how to parse it and then later
              display it on the page. Some CSS3 was used to make the webpage
              look appealing.

              In this project i was part of a team of 4 people. The purpose of
              the project was to create an API to allow easy access to Uvic's
              course scheduling for all of the classes offered. The main purpose
              of creating the API is to use for creating a timetable builder
              webapp which would make the scheduling process very easy for the
              Uvic students. We used TypeScript and Node.js.

                This was my first Coop as a software engineering student. For
                most part of my workterm i used selenium to create automated
                tests for the different web pages. However, in the start i did
                some unit and integration testing. 3 months into the workterm i
                was given a React task. The task was to adjust and add different
                columns to the newly developing web page. During my last month,
                i was put in charge of the Jenkins build to check if any
                unexpected classes failed. If they did it was my duty to fix
                them. <br /><br />I gained experience with the following tools/technologies:
